Code explanation:

LeadsService 
- GetLeads returns the in memory mock data. Newly added data is included when called.
- AddLeadsAsync adds to the list in memory. Using async to eventually point to a db in the future.

Controller
- get calls the service get
- AddLeads calls the service add. This is where 3rd party would have access to push data.

Tests
